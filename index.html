            <h3>Provisioning of a Server</h3>
            <p>This project aims to provision and set up a web server where I can deploy a html landing page and it can be accessible on the
                internet. This project will involve the use of AWS cloud platform to set up a linux distribution called "Ubuntu" after which 
                I proceeded to installing a web server named "Apache". It also involved the configuration of some neccesary port and the 
                creation of a landing page that was deployed on the web server that was created. It is expected that during accessment, a 
                landing will be accessed on the web server created from any part of the country.</p>
